    <h1>The History of Bourbon </h1>
    <p> Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey – a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name derives from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is disputed whether its namesake Kentucky county or New Orleans street is the source of the whiskey's name.It has been produced since the 18th century,although the name "Bourbon" was not applied until the 1850s. While it may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South in general, and Kentucky in particular.

  <div class="made"> <h1>Requirements</h1><p>The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits (27 C.F.R. 5) state that bourbon made for U.S. consumption[3] must be:
    <ol>
    <li>Produced in the United States </li>
     <li>made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn;</li><li> aged in new, charred-oak barrels;</li><li>
      distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume)</li>
 <li>entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume) </li><li> be bottled (like other whiskeys) at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume).</li>

  <div class="more"><h2>Bourbon vs Whiskey</h2>
    <p> What's the Difference?</p>
    <ul><li> All bourbon is whiskey but not all whiskey is bourbon. Tennessee whiskey? Not bourbon. Canadian whiskey? Nope. Scotch? Definitely not bourbon... you get the idea.</li>
      <li>Bourbon is all-American. In 1964, under President Lyndon Johnson's administration, Congress declared bourbon America's Native Spirit (LBJ sure enjoyed his bourbon.).</li>
      <li>The only thing that can be added to bourbon is water (and only to bring it down to proof). Other whiskey makers can add colors and flavors to their products.</li>
      <li>Whiskey can age in re-used barrels. By law bourbon must use NEW charred American white oak barrels. Scotch whiskey often recycles barrels first used for bourbon. Probably to try to steal some of the bourbon's flavor!</li>
      <li>It can't say "bourbon" on the label if it's not distilled in the United States. And it can't be "Kentucky Bourbon" unless it's distilled in Kentucky.</li>
