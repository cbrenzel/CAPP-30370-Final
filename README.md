Final Project
---------------------

For my Web Delevopement Final Project, I decided to make a website dedicated to bourbon.
I have always been a fan of bourbon/whiskey and I recently took a distillery tour at Woodford 
Reserve which sparked my interest in learning more. 

I have created a page for others to recieve informaiton and to read about my expirences as 
I visit each stop on the bourbon trail. I hope everyone who visits finds this site informatative and fun. 


## Important Items

#### 2- BreakPoints
While all three pages have three breakpoints in them. The clearest way to 
see them is on the Bourbo Trail page becuase it changes the the most dramitically. The there is always an apparent differnce
at the 700px break point, but the 1000px is more stuble. 

#### 3-coloums 
A three coloumn design was used to lay out the all the distilleries 
on the Bourbon Trail pape when viewed at the desktop level. This shrinks 
to two and then one coloumn as the width of the browser decreases. 

#### CSS Continuous Loop Animation 
This animation is a CSS animation and it can be found on My Distillery Visits page at the bottom 
in the form of a dancing bourbon bottle.

#### CSS User Interaction
Located on the Bourbon Trail page, this CSS user interaction can be found when the mouse hovers over
over each of the disillery boxes. The animation changes the backgorund color and adds a drop shadow. 

#### Background Images
The background of all three pages is an image which repeats. The banner
and the navagation box both have background images as well.  

#### JQuery Interaction
Can be found on the My Distillery Visits page. When you click the 
picture of the Woodford Reserve Distillery it grows in size. This is done using jquery.
