		<div class="rtext2"><p>I really enjoyed my entire experience. The distillery is not hard to find after a short and scenic drive near Frankfort. The parking was close and easily accessible and the staff was very friendly.  The tour itself was fantastic! The tour guide was funny and very knowledgeable and we were able to see every step in the bourbon making process.  My favorite place on the tour was the warehouse in which the barrels are being stored because it smelt delicious in there.  After the tour you receive a tasting and complementary bourbon balls to enjoy! The cost was $7 and the tour including the video took about an hour and a half.  </p>
